"""
DISCO:
 * render_template is a function that takes in, as arguments, a file path relative to templates and as many parameters as you want. The parameters are then replaced in the html file
 * You can pass in your own arguments into a function by writing each argument's name and it's value, separated by an equals sign
 * render_template returns a string
 * In an HTML template, you can put variables to be replaced by putting their name between {{ }}
 * You can write for loops in Jinja by writing {% for item in collection %} and {% endfor %} and placing the content of the loop in between

QCC:
 * What if you place a non-HTML file into Jinja? (We were too lazy to try this out)
 * What it you want your HTML file to contain double squirrely brackets to display on the webpage? How would you write this without it getting interpreted as Jinja syntax

"""

Q0: Removing render_template will make it so that you can't access the template folder and it would result in an error

Q1: 127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template

Q2: model_tmplt.html is the html template we want to yoink
foo is a variable representing the title of the webpage, so if we set it so a string "fooooo", the title will become that string.
collection is also a variable in the html template we replace with coll.
