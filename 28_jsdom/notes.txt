DISCO: 
* functions can also be created using const and arrow syntax
* function() can take 0 arguments, or more, doesn't need to be only one argument
* JS seems to have functions for interacting with html

QCC: 
* are there preimplemented functions for JS interacting with CSS?
* the functions that change the appearance of the page don't change the actual file, since after reloading, the page reverts to its original look
* functions, objects, primitives are all declared using var
