K28 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2023-04-05w

DISCO: 
* functions can also be created using const and arrow syntax
* function() can take 0 arguments, or more, doesn't need to be only one argument
* JS seems to have functions for interacting with html
* DOM is tree representation of HTML file and its elements
* .getElementById() doesn't return list, it returns an object
* just typing variable name will return the content of variable
* typeof will return type of variable
* the function in addEventListener doesn't appear to take parameters

QCC: 
* are there preimplemented functions for JS interacting with CSS?
* the functions that change the appearance of the page don't change the actual file, since after reloading, the page reverts to its original look
* functions, objects, primitives are all declared using var
* element names might be based on id assigned in html
* is there an agreed upon place for the js tag in html file?
* does the typeof operator return anything more specific than just object?
* the variable behavior of functions is clearly visible in addEventListener, since it's just the variable name of the function being inputted as a paramter
* why can't functions in addEventListener take paramters? is there a syntax that allows it?
