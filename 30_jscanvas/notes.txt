K30 -- canvas based JS drawing
2023-04-25t

DISCO: 
* the rectangles and circles created from the draw functions aren't actual elements, since they don't show up in the html on the page
* e.clientX and Y are where the mouse is located relative to the webpage, but e.offsetX and Y are where the mouse is relative to the canvas (or the element the click happened on?)
* the order of ctx.property or ctx.function() can matter
* to access the stuff inside the tag, not just style or id, use .innerHTML, this also allows the insides to be changed

QCC: 
* why aren't the rectangles and circles created elements? are they 
* fillRect does not appear to work with stroke
* it's kind of inconvenient that you need to use the arc function to draw a circle. why is there no circle function?
* also, how would you draw something like an ellipse?
