K31 -- canvas based JS animation
2023-04-25t

DISCO:
    * requestID (output of window.requestAnimationFrame()) gives an id to a frame that is being referred to
    * animation is created by repeatedly calling requestAnimationFrame() in a loop
    * requestAnimationFrame refreshes/run update function at a consistent interval
    * cancelAnimationFrame stops the loop of requestAnimationFrame based off requestID
    * negative radii are not permissable in arc()

QCC:
    * is requestAnimationFrame recursive given how it is written in a function that is its callback function?
    * is there a dedicated function for creating circles? (more compact)
    * When you click requestAnimationFrame that makes it faster, what's actually happening?
        * Is it like some sort of "multi-threading" process?
