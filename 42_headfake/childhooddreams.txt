HW42 -- On Making the Most of Life

time spent: 1.5hrs

Thoughts:
- I like how he treats his life like a software development cycle. Initial plans are set through childhood dreams, and then adjusted to whatever he could possibly do before the deadline. It gives life a bit more structure and intent. The only problem with it is that it leads to the possibility of shrinking your options early on. I like how he ends the talk with “It’s not about how to achieve your dreams. It’s about how to lead your life” because it emphasizes the importance of being open to different routes, beyond just the dreams you set for yourself as a child.
- It’s interesting how when he’s presenting, he doesn’t look into the audience. I do the same thing, and Mykolyk does that as well.
- Was 49:20 the origin of KtS?
- Awww that kiss was so cute
- This talk really made me want to go to CMU even more than I do already

Takeaways:
- Randy Pausch is definitely now one of my role models (although I maybe don’t want to die of cancer at 47)
- “Apologize when you screw up and focus on other people, not on yourself” means a lot to me. I feel like one of my faults is that even if think I’m sincerely apologize for something, I’m still thinking of the fault through the lens of myself, not through the impact of the fault on someone else. This quote is something I’ll keep in mind going forward.
- GOOD ADVICE ABOUT GETTING INTO COLLEGE IM JUST GOING TO BEG ALL THE SCHOOL IM APPLYING TO, TO LET ME IN, THANKS DR PAUSCH
- His advice on how to give feedback is great. “People perceive use as arrogant” is also a bit of a head fake in itself, because it’s implies that the recipient of the comment is not actually arrogant but rather people think they are

Other favorite quotes:
- Some brick walls are made of flesh
