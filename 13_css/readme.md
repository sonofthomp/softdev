## Discoveries/Notable Things
- Tables are very useful for webpage formatting.
- rbg(#, #, #) allows colors to be selected via rgb spectrum.
- padding vs margin vs border:
  - padding is part of an html element's content.
  - border is the edge of an html element's content.
  - margin is the space around the border of an element.
- Inspect element is a handy tool to debug css, especially spacing issues.
- vw adjusts size as a percentage of window width (as opposed to px, which is just pixels).
- letter-spacing is a property that adjusts the space between letters(duh). The pixel value given MUST BE NEGATIVE:
  - letter-spacing: -1px;
