 * When you click the accordion titles, the URL changes to have a pound symbol followed by the id of the accordion tab at the end
 * Foundation makes the page automatically responsive to resizing which is really cool

QCC
 * FEFs get confusing if you don't properly align all ur tags
 * Why are we only able to view one of the accordion tabs at a time

 * If I zoom out in the browser while on the webpage, the image of Moony eventually becomes smaller but the image of Rain always stays the same size. Why is this?
