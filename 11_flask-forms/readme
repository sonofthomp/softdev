DISCO:
* request.args is a MultiDict (similar to a dictionary) that can contain multiple values for the same key. This means we can store multiple usernames in it.
* MultiDicts are useful for storing things like usernames and passwords in a form submission
* running print(request.args['username']) can result in an error because the MultiDict may be empty.
* <form action="/auth"> in the html file connects the front-end to the back-end
* <input type="text" name="username"> in the html file allows us to reference username from the python file as it gets stored in request.args as a key

QCC:
* if request.args can also store passwords, how do people access the MultiDict for heinous purposes?
