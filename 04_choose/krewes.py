K04 -- python file that randomly generates a developer and their period from a
       dictionary. The keys in the dictionary are periods, and each key has a value
       of lists with developer names. The program first randomly selects a key from
       the dictionary using random.choice, then randomly selects a name from the
       list corresponding with that period using random.choice. Finally, the program
       prints out both.
