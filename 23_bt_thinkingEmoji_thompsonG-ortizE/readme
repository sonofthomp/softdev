NOTEABLE
<div class="container text-center">
When a class has spaces in it, that is how you assign multiple classes to a tag.

THE GRID
One useful feature of Bootstrap is the Grid System. To implement this, you need nest div tags and add classes to them to specify how content should work/be styled. They should be nested in this order:

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        content
      </div>

CONTAINERS
* text is automatically left justified
* use class text-center to center the text
* use class text-right to right justify the text

ROWS

COLUMNS JUSTIFYING
* justify-content-start
* justify-content-center
* justify-content-end
* justify-content-around
  * width of displayable space is divided between number of columns
  * each column is centered within it's portion
* justify-content-between
  * space in between each column is equal and there are no margins
* justify-content-evenly
  * displayable space is divided evenly between each column and margins
