HTML file for exploring DOM event propogation using JavaScript

BUBBLE:
    * Event Bubbling is just when the nested events are fired from the child to the parent.
    * Seems to be the default for adding an eventlistener
CAPTURE:
    * Event capture is when the nested events are fired from the child to the parent.
    * can be activated with { capture: true } in the addEventListener function


DISCO:
* e
    * best practice for functions handling events
* e.pD
    * adding it caused code to break
    * best practice for any function handling events

* Best practice 
    *;
    *mdn

* able to add event listener to anything not just buttons

QCC:
* Why is knowing this useful?
    * When would you need to use the boolean argument in addEventListener? (Seems arbitrary)
